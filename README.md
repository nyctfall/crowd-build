# React PC Building Site

This project mainly serves as a learning experience for React.js and Express.js.

PC Part Picker clone, but with news, recommendations (peer-reviewed), reviews (like TechSpot), forum posts (like r/PCMasterRace), and performance tests (like PCMark, Cinebench, PugetBench, 3DMark, GFXBench, SPECviewperf, PassMark, Phoronix, or GeekBench, but all done using Web Assembly and WebGL/WebGPU in the browser). 

Essentially PC Part Picker if combined with an alternate reality version of UserBenchmark that was NOT skewed beyond all sense and reason.
